# skillsDev
This is my very first repository that contains projects that show and aid my development as a programmer.

This repository includes languages;
* Ruby
* Java
* C++
* Python
* Lisp

`learning-cpp/CSCI_PP4/Mine` is where I started. The history for this folder is long and complex.

All other languages and projects exist in the first folder in this directory.
A document template is here also reflecting how I mainly document my code.
