##A short list of the fixes needed for the "complete" functions.

1. Add parameters to structure generation engine.
2. Possibly enable keypress only to move character.

##Here's a list of features that I would like to be implemented:

1. Movement system
2. Random structure generation
3. Gate mechanism's
4. Level swapping
5. Enemies
6. Health system
7. Power-ups
8. Final Boss
9. Dangerous obstacles
10. Puzzles

Build and run the adv_game by running the build.sh file(with proper permissions) or by using the makefile of coarse.
######Use chmod +x <path_to_file_folder_here/build.sh> to give the build file execution permissions.

_Note: The adv_game.cpp file was significantly developed within a derivative file called alternative.cpp, of which I also created._
