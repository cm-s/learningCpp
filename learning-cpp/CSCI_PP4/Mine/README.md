#This file obviously needs to be updated

A quick list of things that need to be worked on in the program:
1. make setKey() value diverse.
2. create functional random number generator.
3. fix spacing and numbering.
4. remove the "that is not a move" when initializing any grid.
5. overload character_dynamic instead of redeclaring it.
