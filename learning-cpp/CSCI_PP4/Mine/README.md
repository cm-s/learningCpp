##A short list of the fixes needed for the "complete" functions.

1. Add parameters to structure generation engine.
2. Possibly enable keypress only to move character.

##Here's a list of features that I would like to be implemented:

1. Movement system
2. Random structure generation
3. Gate mechanism's
4. Level swapping
5. Enemies
6. Health system
7. Power-ups
8. Final Boss
9. Dangerous obstacles
10. Puzzles

_Note: The adv_game.cpp file was significantly developed within a derivative file called alternative.cpp, also created by me._
