##A short list of the fixes needed for the "complete" functions.

1. Make setKey() value diverse.
2. Create functional random number generator.
3. Fix spacing and numbering.
4. Remove the "that is not a move" when initializing any grid.
5. Overload character_dynamic instead of redeclaring it.

##Here's a list of features that I would like to be implemented:

1. Movement system
2. Random structure generation
3. Gate mechanism's
4. Level swapping
5. Enemies
6. Health system
7. Power-ups
8. Final Boss
9. Dangerous obstacles
10. Puzzles

_Note: The adv_game.cpp file was significantly developed within a derivative file called alternative.cpp._
