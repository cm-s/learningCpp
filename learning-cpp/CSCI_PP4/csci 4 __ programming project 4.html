<span class="sectiontitle">Submitting your work:</span>
	<p>
		Complete this exercise on your own.
	</p>
	<p>
		Solve the problem described below by designing, implementing, and testing a 
		Python program.
	</p>
	<p>
		Email your Python code to the instructor at jboydt@foobt.net before the deadline.
	</p>

<span class="sectiontitle">Description:</span>

	<p>
		For this project, you will (1) design and (2) and implement a simple adventure game. You can choose 
		any theme for your game you want -- fighting monsters and collecting gold, picking up and eating candy, 
		flying a spaceship to different planets to trade goods, raising animals on a farm, tutoring a student for school 
		-- any theme you want, as long as your game addresses the technical requirements (listed below).
	</p>
	<p>
		We will share game design ideas and theme ideas together in class, so do not worry if you have not played or created 
		a game like this before.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your program will, ultimately, be designed and implemented as an object-oriented system. It is assumed that when 
		you start you do not know object-orientation, but do not let that stop you -- you can implement the program as you 
		have implemented your other programs to date, and translate it later into an object-oriented system. We will work 
		together in class so you will know how to do this.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your program will have the following components:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			a Player class (in a file Player.py), with the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					a constructor that accepts a name for the player and initializes attributes to reasonable start values
				</li>
				<li>
					a dictionary to store: the player name, points/gold/candy (based on your chosen theme), plus any 
					other player attributes you want to include
				</li>
				<li>
					a list to store items found, or rooms visited, or whatever you choose to store in the list
				</li>
				<li>
					methods to set the various attributes, get the various attributes, add items to the list, view 
					items in the list
				</li>
				<li>a method to print all of the values of the player attributes and all of the items in the list</li>
				<li>other methods as needed to implement your design</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			a Room class (in a file Room.py), with the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					a constructor that accepts a name for the player and initializes attributes to reasonable start values
				</li>
				<li>
					a name
				</li>
				<li>
					a description
				</li>
				<li>
					methods to set the name and description, get the name and description
				</li>
				<li>
					a method representing the primary activity of the room, such as fighting a monster, or solving a puzzle, 
					or playing a game (for example, a number guessing game), or whatever activity is appropriate for your theme
				</li>
				<li>other methods as needed to implement your design</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			a Game driver (in a file Game.py; this is where your main menu function will be) that:
			<ul>
				<li>creates an instance of Player</li>
				<li>uses a tuple to create a minimum of three (3) instances of Rooms</li>
				<li>displays the main menu and allows the player to interact with the game</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
 	<p>
		Document all of your Python files using <a href="http://foobt.net/fall2013/csci4_1751/files/basic_module.txt">this sample</a> as a guide.
	</p>
    <p>
        You can find a starter implementation <a href="http://foobt.net/fall2013/csci4_1751/labs/project4data">here</a> (you will need all three files -- run Game.py).
    </p>

<div class="objectiveslist">
<span class="sectiontitle">Objectives:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>practice defining and using functions</li>
		<li>practice using lists</li>
		<li>use a dictionary to store and manage data</li>
		<li>use a tuple to store and access data</li>
		<li>design and implement classes</li>
		<li>create instances of classes</li>
		<li>use import statements to connect your Python files</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="objectiveslist">
<span class="sectiontitle">Requirements:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>technical requirements:
			<ul>
				<li>
					[50 points] all of your source files must be documented correctly (see 
					<a href="http://foobt.net/fall2013/csci4_1751/files/basic_module.txt">the basic_module example</a>) 
					
				</li>
				<li>[50 points] your program must run without errors</li>
				<li>[50 points] all of your user input handling must be robust</li>
				<li>
					[50 points] all of your program outputs should be neatly and consistently 
					formatted using the string <i>format</i> when required
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>feature requirements:
			<ul>
				<li>
					[100 points] implement a Player class to the minimums described above
				</li>
				<li>
					[100 points] implement a Room class to the minimums described above
				</li>
				<li>
					[100 points] implement a Game driver that creates a Player object, creates a minimum 
					of three (3) Room objects and stores them in a tuple, displays the main menu, and allows 
					the user to access all of the game's activities
				</li>
				<li>
					[100 points] the game is reasonably playable (instructor discretion)
				</li>
				<li>
					NOTE: you may implement as many additional functions as you need to complete the program based 
					on your design
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="objectiveslist">
