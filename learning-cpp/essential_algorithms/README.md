##My recreation of a handful of essential algorithms in C++.

As of yet,(_6/5/16_) the combineNum program supplies the user with one function that can accurately combine two strings of positive
integers and return the combination of the two in the form of an int value. Though, the primary function does break down after the input
has reached over nine digits.

The copyIn program is a work in progress. My goal is for the function to act upon a user specified type and return the combination of two
integers or a string of two concatenated strings. It is suggested that this program is compiled using the latest c++17 standard.

The str_to_int program provides one primary function that takes positive whole numeric string as an input, returning an integer version of the string.
This should be able to be easily modified to fit character strings as well.
