##This is a derivative of the adv_game program first written in C++.

#Features implemented include the following;

* Levels two and three
* Character movement
* Enemies
* Power-ups, health shards and a basic sword
* Prototype gate mechanisms
* Structure generation
* In game commands

#There is one uncommon bug I am aware of. Every so often during Character movement a division by zero exception is thrown. This most likely happens very early on.
