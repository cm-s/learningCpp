##Multi-threading in adv_game!
This is a branch which serves the purpose of demonstrate the use of multi-threading in adv_game.
Multi-threading will likely never be implemented into the main program version on the Master branch because it causes interface issues and furthermore isn't feasible for implementation in this game so long as it is only playable through a command line interface. Though, this does pose some potential yet.

If adv_game would ever gain a web interface, for example. multi-threading seems as if it would be a great addition.
Finally, a clean and self cleaning build of adv_game can be compiled and run by executing the build.sh file in a bash shell. Dependencies (Java compiler) must be met obviously to compile this file.
